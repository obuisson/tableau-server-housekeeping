#Tableau Server on Linux Housekeeping Script
#Originally created by Jonathan MacDonald @ The Information Lab

# 	HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT:
#		Create a new directory called scripts in your Tableau server data directory… 
#			mkdir /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/data/scripts
#
#		Copy this file to your server into the above folder… 
#			cp tableau-server-housekeeping.sh /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/data/scripts/
#
#		Change ownership of this directory and its contents to user:tsmagent and group:tableau… 
#			sudo chown -R tsmagent:tableau /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/data/scripts/
#
#		Make the script executable… 
#			sudo chmod +x /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/data/scripts/tableau-server-housekeeping.sh
#
#		Execute the script as the tsm admin user to test it works correctly in your environment…
#			su $tsmuser -c /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/data/scripts/tableau-server-housekeeping.sh
#
#		Schedule it using cron to run on a regular basis…
#			su $tsmuser -c "crontab -e"
#		
#		For example, to schedule it to run once a day at 01:00, add this to your crontab…
#			0 1 * * * /var/opt/tableau/tableau_server/data/scripts/tableau-server-housekeeping-linux.sh > /home/$tsmuser/tableau-server-housekeeping.log
